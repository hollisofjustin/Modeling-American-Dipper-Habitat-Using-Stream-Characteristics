The Dipper is often referred to as an indicator for good water quality due to the diversity of diet and aquatic insects the species feeds on, (Feck &amp; Hall 2004). As an aquatic songbird, preference of stream and environmental characteristics have been studied but non that are specifically designed around the utilization of citizen science observations. In this research, we aim to expand upon the current understanding of environmental preference for American Dipper observations by using publicly available datasets. From a large number of human observations paired with high resolution stream, watershed, and catchment characteristics, we aim to compare and progress our understanding of Dipper habitat. 2.1 Introduction Environmental indicators are important ques that allows us to quickly understand the state of an ecosystem (Watzin &amp; MacIntosh 1999, Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012, Feck &amp; Hall 2004). The response of the environment to pollutants, natural disasters, and anthropocentric disturbance can in return has long been documented (Watzin &amp; MacIntosh 1999, Feck &amp; Hall 2004, Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012). Species presence being a potential response or indicator within an environment is one example to how we use environmental indicators to understand environmental state. Avian presence, can tell us information about the habitat, food, and environmental resource quality (Sullivan, &amp; Vierling 2012). Streams and watershed’s are continuing to be monitored extensively, improving the amount of data and understanding of individual stream characteristics (Erwin &amp; Hamilton 2005, Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012). Unique characteristics of a a stream stretch far beyond the flow line, influences are at the catchment and watershed level (Erwin &amp; Hamilton 2005, Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012). ![American Dipper](&quot;images/dipper.png&quot;) The American Dipper Cinclus mexicanus is an aquatic avian species that ranges from Central America to the furthest northern parts of North America (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). The American Dipper (referred to as ‘Dipper’ from now on) is often described as the only true aquatic passerine of North America (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020, Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012). As an aquatic songbird, the Dipper and water are interconnected. John Muir describe the Dipper extensively, attributing the relationship of the Dipper to streams as ‘inseparable’. Researchers have pointed to the Dipper as an indication of good water quality (Feck &amp; Hall 2004) but begs the question of what stream characteristics do Dippers truly prefer? In addition, can we use these characteristics as a model to explore other streams within their expected range and predict streams that would be favorable habitat for Dipper’s. The goal of this project is to use citizen science observations of the American Dipper to analyze preferred stream and habitat characteristics in Colorado. Stream Selection The interconnections of water quality and Dipper presence is well understood. Yet there are few explorations of the characteristics of streams that yield a dipper observation. Tyler &amp; Ormerod 1994 explored dipper presence in relation to pH and water hardness. Feck &amp; Hall 2004 explored water quality and the abundance of specific insects that Dipper prey upon. Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012 studied multiple environmental factors that influence Dipper presence. What is clear upon review of existing literature is that the credibility for Dippers as an environmental monitor is growing. Stream selection for suitable habitat is often split depending on the season. Dippers are observed year-round in fast moving streams that are unpolluted (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). During the breeding season, Dipper’s move to higher elevations in search for suitable nesting habitat. Dipper’s tend to choose specific stream bank characteristics; steep rocks, cliffs, and over hanging ledges to provide suitable nesting sites (Sullivan, &amp; Vierling 2012; Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). It is noted that during the breeding season, stream width and depth are a priority as the observed characteristics rarely exceed 15 meters in width and 2 meters in depth (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). Another important feature is streams lined with rocks and cobble, providing suitable hatching grounds for food sources (Feck &amp; Hall 2004; Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012). Breeding season fluctuates depending on environmental factors. In fact, their breeding and migration can be influenced by hydrology, emphasizing that the higher amount of discharge in a stream early can result in an earlier Dipper breeding period (Nilsson et al. 2020). Though environmental conditions influence breeding time, Dipper’s typically breed from late March to late April. During the non-breeding season, Dipper’s move to larger streams at lower elevations. Post breeding habitat can include wetlands, mountain lakes, or even coastal estuaries. In the winter, deeper streams with ice-free stretches are preferred for hunting (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). Similar to their breeding habitat, ledges and rocky riparian habitats are preferred for roosting.  Using Citizen Science Data Avian citizen science observations are among the largest citizen science data sets in the world. Continuous monitoring of streams through multiple entities continues to create higher resolution data, and better understanding of stream characteristics. The combination of high observation density and well understood stream characteristics at the catchment and watershed level, allow us to gain a better understanding of physical environmental factors that may influence Dipper presence. In North America, the Dipper is an unmistakable bird, meaning they are not easily confused with any other species. A Dipper is relatively small, warbler sized species ranging from 14-40 cm long, short wings, and a square tail. Adults display a gray, drab, configuration with a slight hint of brown on their head and neck. Their bill is short and dark during breeding season, and lighter in the non breeding season. Dippers are monomorphic but females tend to be smaller than males. The name “Dipper” is certainly related to their behavior. Dippers are known for their “bobbing” an up and down movement hinged at the knees. The species constantly dips, usually around 40-60 times per min, but does not dip while preening(citation Birds of the World). Dipping serves as a function to communicate location, as a warning, deter predators, signal fitness, measure position, and possibly provide better vision into water when browsing for prey. "],["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Collecting Observation Data 3.2 Using StreamCat Tools To Gather Flow line Metrics", " Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Collecting Observation Data To obtain observations for American Dippers, the Global Diversity Information Facility (GDIF) package, occ_data(), was used. GDIF compiles 123 different citizen science observations from eBird, iNaturalist, the Great Backyard Bird Count, and many other data sets (GBIF Secretariat 2022). Observation counts for the Dipper are strictly human observations. To pull the data, a function was created to iterate over the time period of 2013-2020 and the data was filtered to removed observations that lack metadata. # Set up script # function to check for package installation, then install and load libraries packageLoad &lt;- function(x) { for (i in 1:length(x)) { if (!x[i] %in% installed.packages()) { install.packages(x[i]) } library(x[i], character.only = TRUE) } } # vector of packages to load packages &lt;- c(&#39;tidyverse&#39;, &#39;palmerpenguins&#39;, &#39;sf&#39;, &#39;terra&#39;, &#39;tmap&#39;, &#39;rmarkdown&#39;, &#39;tigris&#39;, &#39;elevatr&#39;, &#39;rgdal&#39;, &#39;rgbif&#39;, &#39;soilDB&#39;, &#39;plotly&#39;, &#39;dataRetrieval&#39;, &#39;nhdplusTools&#39;) packageLoad(packages) tmap_mode(&quot;view&quot;) To provide an area of interest (AOI), required by many functions, Tigris was used to pull state and county information. The Tigris package utilizes U.S Census data shape files which provides a state polygon for the specified state. For this project, we used the state of Colorado as an AOI. states &lt;- tigris::states() co &lt;- states %&gt;% filter(NAME == &#39;Colorado&#39;) counties &lt;- tigris::counties(state= &quot;CO&quot;) The nhdplutools package is used to download National Hydrography Data (NHD). By providing an AOI, NHD provides high resolution flow lines and water bodies for Colorado and necessary for analysis. The flow lines will later be used to find which hydrographic feature is associated with each Dipper observation. Each flow line is used to analyze what characteristics attract a Dipper to that particular water body, catchment basin, and watershed. co_flowlines &lt;- get_nhdplus(AOI = co, realization = &#39;flowline&#39;) Using the AOI Dipper data can be pulled from the GDIF database. #make a string of species names to use in the &#39;occ_data&#39; function species &lt;- &quot;Cinclus mexicanus&quot; #also make a string of common names common_name &lt;- &quot;American Dipper&quot; emptylist &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, length = length(species)) commonemplist &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, length = length(common_name)) #funtion for pulling dipper data crawl &lt;- function(year){ for (i in 1:length(species)) { #this function can pull data for multiple species occ &lt;- occ_data( #parameters outlined by the package to pull species specific data scientificName = species[[i]], hasCoordinate = TRUE, #spatial coordinates are an important feature for the observations geometry = st_bbox(co), #identifying the AOI to get observation within colorado year = year, ) %&gt;% .$data # # add species name column as ID to use later occ$ID &lt;- common_name [[i]] #clean by removing duplicate occurrences emptylist[[i]] &lt;- occ %&gt;% distinct(decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% dplyr::select(Species = ID, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, year, month, basisOfRecord) #grabbing geographic coordinates, year, month, and the type of record.

Due to the nature of Dipper’s, all of the observations are assumed to be by or within a water body. The st_nearest_feature function finds the nearest NHD Colorado flow line and attaches the dipper observation. By attaching the observation to the river, we obtain the COMID (a unique identifier for hydrologic features) which will be used to retrieve data through the StreamCat package. After pairing the observation with flow lines, we tested the assumption of Dipper observations and their association with water by calculating the distance to that feature. #Attaching the observation to the nearest feature nearestriver &lt;- st_nearest_feature(dipperunique, co_flowlines) #Calculating the distance from the observation to the feature in meters distanceobs &lt;- st_distance(dipperunique, co_flowlines[nearestriver,], by_element = T) #adding nearest river and distance to that river to our data frame dipperunique&lt;-dipperunique %&gt;% mutate(distancefromriver = distanceobs, nearestriver = nearestriver) #st_nearest_river only provides the index of the flowline observation so we have to match the index of the row id with the flowline dipperwflow&lt;- left_join(st_drop_geometry(dipperunique), st_drop_geometry(co_flowlines), by=&#39;nearestriver&#39;) %&gt;% rename(COMID = comid) 3.2 Using StreamCat Tools To Gather Flow line Metrics StreamCat is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dataset that compiles over 600 metrics for streams across the United States (Hill et al 2016). StreamCat was chosen because of the diversity of data that can be retrieved using one package. Since the goal of this project was to explore the characteristics of watersheds and catchment basins that are known to have a dipper presence, StreamCat is the perfect data set because the majority of metrics are measured at both the catchment and watershed level. Initially, twenty different variables were chosen to explore.The initial metrics explored were Dam Density, Base Flow Index, Elevation, Wetted Width, Thalweg Depth, Bankfull Width, Bankfull Depth, Nitrogen Surplus, and Land Cover. Within Land Cover, a percentage for each assigned land cover type is measured at the watershed and catchment level. Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020 describe Dipper habitat in detail, providing a filter to the Land Cover dataset. Land Cover metrics explored are Mixed Forest, Ice, Herbaceous Wetland, Grassland, Deciduous Forest, Conifer Forest, and Woody Wetland. Two years of NLCD fit the study parameters allowing for Land Cover from 2013 and 2019 to be used. All trends were displayed as a histogram where tight distributions were acknowledged and metrics with a uniform distribution were discarded. Important characteristics that are associated with Dipper observations are regional and landscape characteristics like elevation, slope, geographic location, land cover, thalweg depth, bank-full width, and bank full depth (Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012). In the StreamCat dataset, Thalweg Depth, Bank full Width, and Bank full Depth are predicted characteristics utilizing Random Forest models for these estimates (Doyle et al 2023). Baseflow index is the the percent of flow that is baseflow. Elevation and slope are generated from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Landcover is derived from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) from USGS (Dewitz 2021). For this study, NLCD was used for the years 2013 and 2019 to align with the observation years that were defined when extracting GDIF data. # grab distinct comid so not running over multiples dippercomid &lt;- dipperwflow %&gt;% distinct(COMID = COMID) #Using the COMID to pull metrics from the StreamCatTools package streamcattest &lt;- StreamCatTools::sc_get_data(metric =&#39;BFI, Elev, thalweg_depth_cm, bankfull_width_m, bankfull_depth_m, PctConif2013, PctConif2019&#39;, comid = dippercomid$COMID) "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Analyzing Dipper Observations 4.2 Stream Characteristics: Watershed 4.3 Stream Characteristics: Stream", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Analyzing Dipper Observations From the crawl function and years assigned from 2013 - 2023 there were 7408 human observations of Dippers. While the crawl function called for data in 2023, GBIF did not provide data for that year. The majority of observations in the study time frame peaked in 2013 with variability in observations from year to year. The lowest number of observations was in 2022 with only 12 total observations. There is no explanation for why the amount of observations dropped off significantly for this year. yearplot&lt;- ggplot(data = dippdf, aes(year ,fill = season))+ geom_histogram(binwidth=.5)+ scale_fill_manual(values= c(&#39;royalblue3&#39;,&#39;royalblue4&#39;))+ scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021)) yearplot The distribution of Dippers follows their expected distribution shown in (Figure 4.1). Their expected range spans from the Northern portion of South America to northern Alaska. Their distribution is skewed to the western portion of North America due to their attraction to high mountain, cold, and fast running streams (Watzin &amp; MacIntosh 1999, Feck &amp; Hall 2004, Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012, Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/american_dipper_range.png&quot;) Figure 4.1: American Dipper Range from Alaska to South America. In Colorado, Dipper Range consists of high elevations on the western portion of the state boundary (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020) In Colorado, observations were on the western portion of the state. The higher elevation and runoff fed streams provide suitable in their range (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). Our NHD function provide 63,108 distinct linear features in Colorado. Of those 63,000 features, 2154 unique COMID’s were associated with a dipper observation, meaning 3 percent the streams in Colorado had a Dipper sighting between 2013 and 2022. 4.1.0.1 Interactive Map of Dipper Observations in Colorado filterflow &lt;- co_flowines %&gt;% filter(grepl(&#39;River&#39;, gnis_name)) tm_shape(co) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(filterflow)+ tm_lines(col = &quot;midnightblue&quot;, lty= &#39;solid&#39;)+ tm_shape(spatdipvar) + tm_symbols(col = &quot;Species&quot;, palette= &quot;cividis&quot;, n = 1, alpha = 0.8, size = 0.5) + tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE, legend.outside.position = &quot;right&quot;) The average distance from the observation to the flow line was 126.88 meters. While Dipper observations are usually associated with a water feature, citizen science applications prompt the user to associate the sighting with a hot spot nearby instead of attaching a geographic location to each sighting (GBIF Secretariat 2022). When filtering observations for unique COMID’s, the amount of observations that were found at a unique flow line are 2154 observations. 4.2 Stream Characteristics: Watershed Within Colorado, Dippers occupy diverse watersheds. The average watershed area that dippers were found to occupy is 1335 square kilometers, with the majority of observations occurring in watersheds that are 1000 square kilometers (Figure 4.2) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/WSAREASQKM.png&quot;) Figure 4.2: Observations of Dippers plotted over the Watershed Area (SQKM) on a log scale to aquire a normal distribution. The majority of Dipper observations fall within watershed that are 1000 sqaure kilometers. Runoff and base flow index at the watershed level were also analyzed. The average base flow percent for streams was 65%. From this information, we can conclude that from the base flow index, Dipper prefer perennial streams. This observation aligns with Kingery &amp; Wilson (2022) who describe Dipper habitat to be pertinent to flowing water year round. Forests are a dominate land cover type in Colorado and categorized as 30% of the states land cover type. Within the watersheds examined, the average conifer forest land classification in 2013 was 44.36 percent with a standard deviation of 18.86. In 2019, the percentage was slightly less at 44.28% with a standard deviation of 18.78. The distribution of dipper observation to land cover shows the majority of Dipper observations are found within watersheds with conifer forests dominating around 50% (Figure 4.3). In Idaho, Dipper observations were found to be in watersheds that are heavily dominate to evergreen forests (Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012) which could show that Dipper presence could be more dependent on stream characteristics rather than land cover (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/NLPCTCONIF2013WS.png&quot;) Figure 4.3: A comparison of dipper observations plotted over the percent of landcover labeled as Conifer forest. From 2013 to 2019 the average percent of Conifer forests did not differ greatly. The distribution in these plots show that the majority of dipper observations are found where Land Cover types are around 50% conifer within the Watershed knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/NLPCTCONIF2019WS.png&quot;) Figure 4.4: A comparison of dipper observations plotted over the percent of landcover labeled as Conifer forest. From 2013 to 2019 the average percent of Conifer forests did not differ greatly. The distribution in these plots show that the majority of dipper observations are found where Land Cover types are around 50% conifer within the Watershed 4.3 Stream Characteristics: Stream Individual streams where Dipper’s were observed varied in discharge, depth, and width. Using the NHD data, mean annual stream flow for the streams attached to observations averaged 312.243 with the minimum flow at 0.005 and the max at 9679.02 and a standard deviation of 753.87 cubic feet per second. (Figure 4.4) The result of this analysis suggest that Dippers occupy a wide variety of streams in relation to discharge. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/qa_ma.png&quot;) Figure 4.5: Dipper observations are plotted over Mean annual stream flow in log scale. The distribution of Dipper observations show that observations occur where stream flow is around 300 cfs. Slope presumed to be one of the more important factors for Dipper presence. Dipper often choose fast moving streams during breeding season but noted to occupy flat, wide streams during non breeding seasons (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020). Based on the exploration of our data, the average slope during the breeding season was 1.77% and during non breeding was 3.99%. This suggests that during the non breeding season there would be faster moving streams that are preferred. While this data may suggest different from the literature, slope was not analyzed at the exact point of the observation, rather than an average slope over the entire course of the water feature. dipslope &lt;- dippdf %&gt;% group_by(season) %&gt;% summarise(mean(slope)) kbl(dipslope, format= &quot;html&quot;, caption= &quot;Mean Slope of water feature attached to an observation during breeding and non breeding season (%)&quot;, centering = T) Table 4.1: Mean Slope of water feature attached to an observation during breeding and non breeding season (%) season mean(slope) Breeding 0.0177333 NonBreeding 0.0399392 Thalweg depth models also demonstrate the varity of streams occupied by Dippers. the average depth modeled was 52 cm with the minimum thalweg depth at 12 cm and the max 232.41 cm. The standard deviation between these calculation is 30.59. In the analysis with citizen science data bankfull depth models were validated by a focus study. Our result show the average bankfull depth being 1.088 meters with a range from 0.470-3.330 meters. The standard deviation of depth being 0.39 meters. The results that were generated by a random forest model were validated by Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012, where the findings on a focus site in Idaho were similar with average depth found in the study were 1.1 m with a standard deviation of 0.4. These results also confirm the priority of stream depth priority during breeding season to be less than two meters deep (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020) dipseasondepth &lt;- dippdf %&gt;% group_by(season) %&gt;% summarise(mean(BANKFULL_DEPTH_M)) dipseasondepth ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## season `mean(BANKFULL_DEPTH_M)` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Breeding 1.23 ## 2 NonBreeding 1.08 knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/BANKFULL_DEPTH_M.png&quot;) Figure 4.6: Dipper observations are plotted over Bankfull Depth (m) in log scale. The distribution of Dipper observations show that Dippers prefer a shallow stream. The findings from this analysis are validated by Sullivan &amp; Vierlings focal study in Idaho where the average depth was found to be similar to the modeled depth that is provided by the stream Cat database Additionally, the variation of bankfull width when compared to the same study suggests that stream characteristics can vary in width, by depth may be higher priority for Dipper presence. Our analysis show that the mean bankfull width of streams in Colorado is 17.6 m with a range of 2.5 to 122.8 m and a standard deviation of 16.63. Sullivan &amp; Vierling 2012 had a smaller range of bankfull width, 5.7-31.5 m with an average width of 14.8 m and a standard deviation of 6.9. This finding shows there is no similarity in stream width preference and an opportunity to explore how stream width is distributed geographically. This finding however shows that our results exceed the claim in which stream width during breeding season rarely exceeds 15 meters (Kingery &amp; Wilson 2020) where our results find an average width of 21 meters at bankfull. An issue with this finding is that bankfull does not mean the stream is at this width. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/BANKFULL_WIDTH_M.png&quot;) Figure 4.7: Dipper observations are plotted over Bankfull Width (m) in log scale. The distribution of Dipper observations show that Dippers have no preference in stream width when compared to Sullican and vierlings (2012) analysis of environmental characteristics. This suggests that because bankfull width may vary geographically, Dipper presence may not depend on this characteristic. dipseasonwidth &lt;- dippdf %&gt;% group_by(season) %&gt;% summarise(mean(BANKFULL_WIDTH_M)) dipseasonwidth ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## season `mean(BANKFULL_WIDTH_M)` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Breeding 21.8 ## 2 NonBreeding 17.3 "],["discussion.html", "Chapter 5 Discussion", " Chapter 5 Discussion Citizen science data has many challenges, especially spatial bias and temporal bias (Johnston et al.). Users are limited by access to areas in order to make observations. Temporal assumes that the user submitting the observation made a correct identification of the species. While eBird and GBIF have QC protocals which require volunteers to monitor submissions (Johnston et al.), it is difficult to know the reality of the observer and observation. Limitations are when submissions of a species are within range, there is no prompt for reconsideration by a volunteer on eBird. Another large challenge to citizen science data is class imbalance because there will be more non-detection’s than actual detection’s (Johnston et al.). With bias’ and imbalances reliable inferences on the data become a great challenge for data scientists (Johnston et al.). In the future, incorporating non-detection’s to predict presence could strengthen the results of this analysis. While we know from this data set that there is a species detection at this site, non-detection could significantly outweigh an actual detection, rendering one single detection rare or uncommon. This could alter the outcome of environmental characteristic preferences in the analysis, skewing the data to prefer areas that do not normally contain Dippers. It is worth noting that land cover dominance throughout Dipper range can and will occur. For example the land cover dominance in Colorado compared to Washington, differ due to climate. While the comparison in this analysis is with Sullivan and Vierlings 2012 study, Idaho and Colorado have similar climactic attributes which can help validate the analysis. Slope being an important attribute to dipper presence could have been analyzed more efficiently. In the future, pulling a specific slope attribute from the Dipper observation could have yielded more accurate results compared to the outcome from average slope calculation in the NHD data set. While our analysis is contrary to the literature, it is worth noting that the average slope of streams during breeding and non breeding has some significance. This could raise the question for whether streams with an average slope percentage that is higher has less the volume of water in the non breeding season, improving hunting success throughout the winter. However, this was not explored throughout this research. "],["references.html", "References", " References Doyle, J. M., Hill, R. A., Leibowitz, S. G., &amp; Ebersole, J. L. (2023).
