# Abstract

The American Dipper (*Cinclus mexicanus*) is an avian species that is primarily found in aquatic environments. The Dipper is often referred to as an indicator for good water quality due to the diversity of diet and aquatic insects the species feeds on, (Feck & Hall 2004). As an aquatic songbird, preference of stream and environmental characteristics have been studied but non that are specifically designed around the utilization of citizen science observations. In this research, we aim to expand upon the current understanding of environmental preference for American Dipper observations by using publicly available datasets. From a large number of human observations paired with high resolution stream, watershed, and catchment characteristics, we aim to compare and progress our understanding of Dipper habitat.
